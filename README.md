# CloudNative

Created in GatsbyJS using a standard Gatstrap (bootstrap) theme.

## Adding Content

Content is automagically generated by dropping markdown files in to subdirectories in the `pages/curriculum` directory.

The subdirectories for each curriculum title are there for the sake of tidiness only.

How to add new content pages:

1. Creat a subdirectory for your new post in `pages/curriculum/{section}`
1. The post must be a markdown file
1. The top of the markdown file must include some metadata for routing/naming. Copy an existing post to use as a template and pay particular attention to the url path.
1. Place images in the same directory as your post and reference them in your markdown as such, e.g `![](./photo.png)`
1. To add posts to the site navigation, edit the `posts` const in `https://github.com/oracle/cloudnative/blob/master/src/components/PostNavi/index.jsx#L11`. Note that "\_" means the root node of a section.

Once this is done, build and deploy via:

```
gatsby build --prefix-paths && ./node_modules/gh-pages/bin/gh-pages -d public
```

Gatsby will carry out some magic that will push the built version of the site to the `public` branch of this repo. The site will be visible on `http://oracle.github.io/cloudnative` within a few minutes. 

## Todo

* Dynamically load the navigation bar based on the existing posts.
