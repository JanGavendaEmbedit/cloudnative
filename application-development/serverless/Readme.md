# Serverless

Serverless is an event-driven application architecture which abstracts infrastructure resources and enables teams to focus on writing code. The compute component of a Serverless platform is known as FaaS, or Functions-as-a-Service. Applications are implemented as groups of loosely coupled functions, and these functions are deployed and invoked for the user by the platform.

When leveraging a managed Serverless platform users are billed only for execution time, which can result in considerable savings as idle time does not incur cost. Resources are automatically scaled up and down based upon need, without the user needing to worry about host provisioning, maintenance and other infrastructure concerns.
