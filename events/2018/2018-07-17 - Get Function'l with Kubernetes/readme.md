# Get Function'l with Kubernetes

2018-07-17 00:00  - Austin, TX

## Description

Agenda
5:00pm - 5:30pm Mix and Mingle
5:30pm - 5:35pm Welcome, Bob Quillin
5:35pm - 6:05pm Kube Apps in Action
Karthik Gaekwad
There are many Kubernetes presentations, but seeing is believing! In this talk, we'll run through some demos of popular tooling provided by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) that help you build resilient microservices based applications. We'll start by deploying a sample Java web application on top of Oracle Kubernetes Engine, and build an ingress controller for the application. Next, we'll verify that our application logs flow into Kibana using Fluentd, followed by looking at application metrics, monitoring using Prometheus, and tracing application issues using Jaeger. At the end of the session, you'll have a better understanding of all of the tooling that cloud native developers use to build, and monitor their microservices.

6:10pm - 6:40pm Kubernetes service delivery at scale without magic: a FaaS case study
TJ Fontaine
Sift through the hype of Kubernetes to learn how to build a cloud scale Functions-as-a-Service using the open source Fn Project. In this talk we'll cover being able to identify the key requirements for your service, how to translate those requirements into useful Kubernetes abstractions, understanding the availability and blast radius for your service, when and when not to lean into Kubernetes, and how to leverage Helm for deployments and rollbacks.

6:50pm -- 7:30pm Cloud Native in an AI and Big Data World
Bob Quillin (Moderator)
Hear from local Austin tech leaders who will explore the future of cloud native technology (open source, containers, Kubernetes, serverless, etc) as we move into an AI and Big Data driven world and economy.
