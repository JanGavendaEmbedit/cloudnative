# Serverless NYC: Running Serverless on Oracle Cloud

2018-10-11 00:00  - New York, NY

## Description

Through the context of deploying a Serverless application on Kubernetes, we’ll run through an overview of Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, Oracle Container Engine and the open source, cloud agnostic Fn Project. We will migrate our Serverless application from a development environment to a fully managed container cluster running on OCI. We’ll discuss the pros and cons of deploying a Serverless application to a managed cluster service, and why you may want to in the first place.
