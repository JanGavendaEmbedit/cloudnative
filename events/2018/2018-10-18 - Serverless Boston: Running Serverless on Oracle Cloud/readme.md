# Serverless Boston: Running Serverless on Oracle Cloud

2018-10-18 00:00  - Boston, MA

## Description

We'll deploy a Serverless application on Kubernetes, while providing an overview of Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, Oracle Container Engine and open source, cloud agnostic Fn Project. We'll then deploy this application to a managed cluster service, and examine why you may want to do so in the first place.
