# CloudNative

Created in GatsbyJS using a standard Gatstrap (bootstrap) theme.

## Adding Content

Content is automagically generated by dropping markdown files in to subdirectories in the `pages/curriculum` directory.

The subdirectories for each curriculum title are there for the sake of tidiness only.

How to add new content pages:

1. Creat a subdirectory for your new post in `pages/curriculum/{section}`
2. The post must be a markdown file
3. The top of the markdown file must include a section like:

```
--
title: "Configuring Ingress and Routing"
date: "2018-06-04T00:00:00.000Z"
path: "/kubernetes/ingress"
curriculum: "Kubernetes"
---
```

The path should match the curriculum name, which should match the subdirectory name of the curriculum that it resides in.

Eventually, menu items will be populated dynamically, but for now must be done manually in `components/PostNavi/index.jsx'

Create new menu items to match your path names above as required.
