# Infrastructure as Code

Infrastructure as code (IaC) is the process of creating and using software that manages configuration and automated provisioning of infrastructure services. As an example, Terraform simplifies the adoption and management of IaC for building, changing, and versioning infrastructure safely and efficiently. Using code to provision and deploy servers and applications is attractive to software developers because it means that they do not have to rely on system administrators to provision and manage the operations aspect of an environment; such a developer can write an IaC process to provision and deploy a new application for quality assurance or experimental deployment.

However, IaC poses a learning curve and leaves little room for error, making tracking revisions via version control more important  and have comprehensive pre-release testing.
