# Logging

Logging is a foundational part of application development and has many variations from applications and languages. There are two reasons logging is performed: diagnostic and audit.

Diagnostic logs can provide a developer tasked with debugging or maintaining code with useful clues when trying to understand what the offending code does, and thus how to maintain it or fix it.

Audit logging is a business requirement. Where the diagnostic logging takes care of recording the events that happen during runtime, audit logging is responsible for recording more abstract, business logic events in the system (adding/editing/removal of content, transactions, access data), and these are what management and legal are interested in.
