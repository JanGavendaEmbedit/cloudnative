# Telemetry

Telemetry involves big data technologies that take enormous amounts of relatively unstructured time series data. This data is aggregated in "data-rich" centralized systems with the aim of providing sophisticated and detailed reports to help organizations operate more efficiently, better understand customers, improve decision-making, and increase the value of the business. Organizations in a variety of industries are using IoT.
